# 25 + 5 Clock

The 25 + 5 Clock app, also known as the Pomodoro Timer, helps users manage their work and break intervals efficiently. This tool encourages productivity by breaking down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by shorter breaks.

## Features

- **Adjustable Times**: Users can increase or decrease the length of both the work session and the break session.
- **Start/Stop Functionality**: Allows the user to start or pause the timer whenever necessary.
- **Reset Functionality**: Resets the timer to its initial state.
- **Audio Notification**: Plays a sound at the end of a session to notify the user.

## Live Demo

You can try the live demo of the app [here](https://codepen.io/Abdulsalam-Ahmed/pen/JjqPJYq).

## How to Use

1. **Set the desired time** for both the work and break periods using the increase and decrease buttons.
2. **Start the timer** to begin the session.
3. **Pause the timer** if you need a break or need to stop temporarily.
4. **Reset the timer** to start your sessions over again.
5. At the end of the session, the app will automatically switch between the work and break periods and will play a sound to indicate the end of a session.
