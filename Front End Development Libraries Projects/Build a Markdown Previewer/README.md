# Markdown Previewer

This Markdown Previewer is a web application built with React. It allows users to enter Markdown text and see a real-time preview of the rendered HTML output. This project utilizes libraries such as `marked` for Markdown parsing and `dompurify` for sanitizing HTML output to ensure safe content rendering.

## Features

- **Live Markdown Editing**: Instantly convert your Markdown text to HTML.
- **Fullscreen Mode**: Maximize the editor or the previewer for better visibility.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Easily distinguish code from text.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across different devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Marked**: A markdown parser and compiler.
- **DOMPurify**: Sanitizes HTML and prevents XSS attacks.
- **classnames**: A utility for conditionally joining classNames together.
- **Skypack**: Used to import these libraries directly in the browser.
