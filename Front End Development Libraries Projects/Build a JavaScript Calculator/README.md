# JavaScript Calculator

This project is a simple JavaScript calculator that provides basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with functionalities to clear input and compute results. It's built using React and is styled with simple CSS for a clean user interface.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic**: Perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Input/Output Display**: View your input and the result of the expression.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile browsers.
- **Clear Functionality**: Ability to clear the current operation using the 'AC' button.
- **Continuous Operations**: Chain multiple operations together.
- **Decimal Operations**: Support for decimal values.

## Technology

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS**: Styling for the calculator.
- **CodePen**: The project is hosted on CodePen, allowing you to view and interact with the calculator directly in your web browser.

## Project Structure

- `Display`: Component to render the input and result.
- `Key`: Component to render each button on the calculator.
- `Keyboard`: Component to render the full set of calculator keys.

### Logic

- The calculator logic handles different types of input, such as numbers, operators, and other keys like the decimal point.
- Input handling ensures that the calculator behaves correctly when you press sequences of keys, including handling multiple operators and building numbers with decimal points.

## How to Use

To use the calculator, simply:

1. Open the [project link](https://codepen.io/Abdulsalam-Ahmed/pen/BaeBREL) in your browser.
2. Click on the keys on the calculator to input expressions.
3. Click the equals (`=`) key to evaluate the expression.
4. Use the 'AC' key to clear the current expression and start a new calculation.

## Future Enhancements

- Adding more complex mathematical functions such as exponentiation, square roots, and trigonometric functions.
- Implementing a history feature to view previous calculations.
- Enhancing the mobile responsiveness and UI aesthetics.
